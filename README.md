# <p align="center">lrcsnc But Removed Romanization</p>
Gets the currently playing song's synced lyrics and displays them in sync with song's actual position!

This version of lrcsnc got rid of the music playing animation and replaced with shortened word like SNF (Sound not found), you will like it if you don't want tonns of animation going around in your waybar!

lrcsnc is primarily designed for bars like [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar).
