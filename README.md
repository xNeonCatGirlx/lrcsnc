- [ ] There is definitely always more!

## Need help or want to contribute?
You can always make an issue for either a bug or a feature suggestment! If your question is more general, consider opening a discussion.

## Your song was not found?
Consider adding the lyrics for it! Currently lrcsnc uses *LrcLib*, which is a great open-source lyrics provider service that has its own easy-to-use [app](https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget) to download or upload lyrics. Once the lyrics are uploaded, lrcsnc should be able to pick them up on the next play of the song (that is if the cached version is not available though).
